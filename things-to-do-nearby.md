Back in 1822, the Forth &amp; Clyde and the Union canals met at Falkirk, linking Scotland's North Sea and Atlantic coasts. A series of 11 locks were used to level out a 36 metre height difference between the two canals. But it was abandoned in the 1960s when motorways took over. The Falkirk Wheel was built to replace that flight of locks, and carry boats from one level to another. It's unique.
